Closing Hymn: "Take the Word of God With You"by Christopher WalkerTake the word of God with you as you go.Take the seeds of God's word and make them grow.Go in peace to serve the world, in peace to serve the world,Take the love of God, the love of God with you as you go.Take the peace of God with you as you go.Take the seeds of God's peace and make them grow.Go in peace to serve the world, in peace to serve the world,Take the love of God, the love of God with you as you go.Take the joy of God with you as you go.Take the seeds of God's joy and make them grow.Go in peace to serve the world, in peace to serve the world,Take the love of God, the love of God with you as you go.Take the hope of God with you as you go.Take the seeds of God's hope and make them grow.Go in peace to serve the world, in peace to serve the world,Take the love of God, the love of God with you as you go.
